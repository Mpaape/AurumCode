Addresses all security and quality issues:

**Security:**
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Hash passwords before storage
- Add authentication checks on all endpoints
- Add authorization checks for admin operations
- Implement CSRF token validation
- Never expose passwords in API responses

**Performance:**
- Add pagination to list endpoint
- Optimize loop string building

**Maintainability:**
- Reduce cyclomatic complexity with strategy pattern
- Extract discount calculation logic
- Improve variable naming
- Add proper error handling

**Reliability:**
- Replace panic with proper error handling
- Add comprehensive logging
- Validate all inputs

Fixes: #1"

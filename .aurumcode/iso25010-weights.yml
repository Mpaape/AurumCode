# ISO/IEC 25010 Quality Characteristics Weights
# Values should sum to 1.0 (or 100%)

weights:
  # Functional Suitability: Degree to which product provides functions that meet stated and implied needs
  functionality: 0.15

  # Reliability: Degree to which a system performs specified functions under specified conditions
  reliability: 0.15

  # Usability: Degree to which product can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals
  usability: 0.10

  # Performance Efficiency: Performance relative to amount of resources used under stated conditions
  efficiency: 0.12

  # Maintainability: Degree of effectiveness and efficiency with which product can be modified
  maintainability: 0.18

  # Portability: Degree of effectiveness and efficiency with which system can be transferred
  portability: 0.08

  # Security: Degree to which product protects information and data
  security: 0.17

  # Compatibility: Degree to which product can exchange information with other systems
  compatibility: 0.05

# Scoring thresholds
thresholds:
  excellent: 90  # 90-100
  good: 75       # 75-89
  acceptable: 60 # 60-74
  poor: 40       # 40-59
  critical: 0    # 0-39

# Static analysis signals and their weights
static_signals:
  # Complexity signals
  complexity_increase: -5  # Penalty per 10 point increase in complexity
  complexity_decrease: 3   # Bonus per 10 point decrease

  # Code quality signals
  todo_comments: -2        # Penalty per TODO comment
  fixme_comments: -3       # Penalty per FIXME comment
  code_smells: -4          # Penalty per detected code smell

  # Test coverage signals
  test_coverage_increase: 5   # Bonus per 10% coverage increase
  test_coverage_decrease: -10 # Penalty per 10% coverage decrease

  # Documentation signals
  missing_docs: -2         # Penalty per undocumented public function
  added_docs: 3            # Bonus per newly documented function
